# Ethereum/EVM Compatible DSNP Implementation
__Version 1.1.0__

### Deprecation Warning: EVM implementation is deprecated in favor of the [Frequency Implementation](../Frequency/Overview.md).

DSNP on Ethereum is designed using smart contracts and log messages.
Smart contracts are used for identity and delegation.
Log messages are used for announcement publishing via batches.

## Solidity

All included Solidity interfaces are targeting the Solidity language version 0.8.x.
Other versions may be available in the [official contracts code repository](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/contracts).

## Contracts and Interfaces

Official DSNP interfaces, contracts, and deployment information may be found in [GitHub](https://github.com/LibertyDSNP/contracts).
