## Future

Below is a tentative roadmap to what protocol features are being developed next!
Items are ordered by current priority.

### Chain Migration
*Status: In progress*

The cost to use Ethereum is too high.
Migrate the DSNP architecture to another chain.

### Private Graph
*Status: Whitepaper*

Keep some graph connections private with permissioned access.

### Direct Messaging
*Status: Whitepaper*

One-to-one messaging with metadata privacy.

### Public Friends
*Status: Not Started*

Graph connections are currently limited to one-way follow relationships.
Build support for other forms of relationships that require all parties to opt-in.

### Social Account Recovery
*Status: Not Started*

Use the social graph to leverage safe account recovery and protect against private key losses.

### Private Friends
*Status: Not Started*

Expand private graph to other relationships while maintaining metadata protection.

### Verified Attributes
*Status: Not Started*

Some users and applications need social identities with additional layers of validation.
How can these be created while being privacy preserving and support an open system.

### Distributed Content Moderation
*Status: Not Started*

Content moderation is hard because it means different things to different people.
Make customizing content moderation easier through distributing the work and results.

### Namespace and Multichain support
*Status: Not Started*

Identity and content from other systems could be used without needing to understand the originating system.
Support DSNP across multiple chains to increase user choice and avoid locking data to one chain or network.

### Content Bridges
*Status: Not Started*

Open social network bridges would allow more content and users to be accessible to all via DSNP.

### Service-Node Protocols
*Status: Not Started*

Sub-specifications targeted at ecosystem services to promote interoperability.

### Private Group Messaging
*Status: Not Started*

Secure many-to-many conversions.
Group chat style still with metadata privacy.

### Private Posts to Friends
*Status: Not Started*

Secure one-to-many posts that still allow for commenting.

### Third-party Identity Bridges
*Status: Not Started*

Create ways for users to be able to bring their own identities or connect a DSNP Identity with outside identities.

### Archivists
*Status: [Draft](Draft/Archivists.md)*

Long-term storage for announcements and perhaps expanding to content storage.

### Peer-to-Peer publishing
*Status: Not Started*

Build a peer-to-peer system for announcement publishing for faster routing and message delivery.
