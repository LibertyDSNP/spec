# Activity Content Specification
__Version pre-1.2.0__

Content references shared via the DSNP consist of URLs pointing to documents containing Activity Streams JSON objects.
For the purposes of the DSNP, restrictions are placed on the [Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) specification.

## JSON-LD and Activity Streams

All DSNP Activity Content is compatible with the [Activity Streams 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/) specification.
While there are some DSNP extensions, they are guaranteed to use non-colliding terms.
Therefore, the JSON-LD `@context` field is set to `https://www.w3.org/ns/activitystreams` according to [Activity Streams 2.0 ยง2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-core/#jsonld).

## Core Activity Content Types

DSNP uses only the following content types at the root level:

| Name | Description | DSNP Announcements |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------------- |
[Note](Types/Note.md) | standard user content | [Broadcast](../DSNP/Types/Broadcast.md), [Reply](../DSNP/Types/Reply.md) |
[Profile](Types/Profile.md) | user profile content | [Profile](../DSNP/Types/Profile.md) |

## Associated Types

| Name | Description | Specification |
| ---- | ----------- | ------------- |
[Location](Associated/Location.md) | add a location to content | [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) |
[Tag](Associated/Tag.md) | add a tag to content | [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) |
[Attachments](Associated/Attachments.md) | supported attachment types | [Activity Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/activitystreams-vocabulary/) |
[Hash](Associated/Hash.md) | content validation hash | DSNP Extension |

## Supported URL Schema

URLs in DSNP-compatible Activity Content MUST use one of the following URL schemes:

| Scheme | Description | Reference | DSNP Version Added |
| ------ |------------ | --------- | ------------------ |
| HTTPS | Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure | [RFC2818](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2818) | 1.0 |
| HTTP | Hypertext Transfer Protocol | [RFC2616](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2616) | 1.0 |

## Non-Normative

## Additional Fields

Implementers may choose to support more of the Activity Streams standard as long as it does not conflict with this specification, but should note that other implementations may not recognize those additions.
Implementers who extend their support for Activity Streams objects beyond the subset defined here do so at their own risk.
