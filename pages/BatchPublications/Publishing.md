```

| Field | Description | Type | Indexed |
| ------------- |------------- | ---- | --- |
| `announcementType` | The single announcement type in the given file | int16 | YES
| `fileHash` | [keccak-256](https://keccak.team/files/Keccak-submission-3.pdf) hash of the batch file | bytes32 | no
| `fileUrl` | URL to retrieve the referenced batch file via an [approved schema](/BatchPublications/Overview#batch-file-retrieval) | string | no

## Publisher Contract Requirements

Contracts that allow for generating `DSNPBatchPublication` are called publishers.
A standard interface is available for use.

## IPublish Interface

```solidity
interface IPublish {
    struct Publication {
        int16 announcementType;
        string fileUrl;
        bytes32 fileHash;
    }

    /**
     * @dev Log Event for each batch published
     * @param announcementType The type of Announcement in the batch file
     * @param fileHash The keccak hash of the batch file
     * @param fileUrl A url that resolves to the batch file
     */
    event DSNPBatchPublication(int16 indexed announcementType, bytes32 fileHash, string fileUrl);

    /**
     * @param publications Array of Batch struct to publish
     */
    function publish(Publication[] calldata publications) external;
}
```
