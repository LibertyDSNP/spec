# DSNP Specification

Welcome to the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) specification!
Here you can find the detailed specification documentation for DSNP, officiation implementation specifications, associated specifications, and roadmap and proposals for future extensions.

## Goals & Purpose

The free communication of users on the internet faces a variety of problems in the modern day.
These challenges include censorship from state and corporate actors, the amplification of misinformation through viral content, and an ever-shrinking collection of near monopolies with absolute power over social interaction in the 21st century.
Through the DSNP, we hope mitigate and ideally solve these challenges in the way social interaction operates online.

## How to Read This Specification

There are three core specifications currently.

| Name | Version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [DSNP](/DSNP/Overview) | 1.0.0 | The implementation agnostic DSNP specification |
| [DSNP Implementations](/Implementations) | - | Implementation specific specifications |
| [Activity Content](/ActivityContent/Overview) | 1.0.0 | A specification for DSNP referenced content (sub-set of W3C Activity Streams) |

Each specification is divided into several modules.
Each module describes a mostly self-contained aspect of the specification.

## Versioning

DSNP specification versions follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) for releases.
