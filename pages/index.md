# DSNP Specification

Welcome to the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol (DSNP) specification.
Here you can find the detailed specification documentation for DSNP, official implementation specifications, associated specifications, as well as a roadmap and proposals for future extensions.

## Goals & Purpose

Free communication among users on the Internet faces a variety of problems in the modern day.
These challenges include censorship by state and corporate actors, the amplification of misinformation through viral content, and an ever-shrinking collection of near monopolies with absolute power over social interaction in the twenty-first century.
Through the DSNP, we hope to mitigate and ideally solve these challenges in the way social interaction operates online.

## How to Read This Specification

There are three core specifications currently.

| Name | Version | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [DSNP](DSNP/Overview.md) | 1.2.0 | The implementation-agnostic DSNP specification |
| [DSNP on Frequency (Pre-release)](Frequency/Overview.md) | pre-1.0.0 | Frequency implementation for DSNP specification |
| [Activity Content](ActivityContent/Overview.md) | 1.1.0 | A specification for DSNP-referenced content (subset of W3C Activity Streams) |

Each specification is divided into several modules.
Each module describes a mostly self-contained aspect of the specification.

## Versioning

DSNP specification versions follow [Semantic Versioning 2.0](https://semver.org/) for releases.
